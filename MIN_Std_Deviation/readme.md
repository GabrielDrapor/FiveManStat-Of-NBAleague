# MIN_Std_Deviation

Recently, I was wondering which team in NBA League has the most balanced usage of lineups. So I crawl the data of minutes of played of each players in each team, and then calculate the standard deviation.

To my surprise, the team with the smallest std deviation is not SanAntonio Spurs but Brooklyn Nets. And in front of the list, most teams are "lottery team", that sounds reasonable.

The code is still shitty, maybe I'll fix it someday.

Up to 17/03/28, the rank of team is:

Brooklyn Nets

Sacramento Kings

Chicago Bulls

Los Angeles Lakers

Phoenix Suns

Memphis Grizzlies

San Antonio Spurs

Atlanta Hawks

Philadelphia 76ers

Utah Jazz


Oklahoma City Thunder

Orlando Magic

Toronto Raptors

New York Knicks

Milwaukee Bucks

Golden State Warriors

Los Angeles Clippers

Denver Nuggets

Cleveland Cavaliers

Miami Heat

Indiana Pacers

Charlotte Hornets

Boston Celtics

Detroit Pistons


Dallas Mavericks

New Orleans Pelicans

Washington Wizards

Portland Trail Blazers

Minnesota Timberwolves

Houston Rockets

# MIN_Std_Deviation

Recently, I was wondering which team in NBA League has the most balanced usage of lineups. So I crawl the data of minutes of played of each players in each team, and then calculate the standard deviation.

To my surprise, the team with the smallest std deviation is not SanAntonio Spurs but Brooklyn Nets. And in front of the list, most teams are "lottery team", that sounds reasonable.
